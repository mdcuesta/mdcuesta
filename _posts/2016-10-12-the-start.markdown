It was over a month ago since I resigned from Accenture.  I took the risk and quit a stable job over a homebased opportunity.  

#### Why?

* The comfort of working at home
* No more heavy traffic
* No more work overtime
* No more dress codes
* No more corporate bull****

Aside from those things mentioned above I have always plan to start my own startup company and I believe I can't do that while in Accenture.  In a homebased job I have full control of my time allowing me to do other things like coding an application I have in mind.

#### This 2017, I Plan to

* Create an application for the Real Estate Market in the Philippines
* Get socialized with other geeks
* Study Data Science and Machine Learning
* Sleep a lot
* Start a start up
* Learn how to write

Everything is in progress but it is still a long way to go. Hope I made the right decision.
